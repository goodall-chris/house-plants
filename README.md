A growing collection of plants at home. Meant to be a record of watering and
preferred sunlight instructions.

### Philodendron Squamiferum

appearance | water | sun | fertilization | pet
---------- | ----- | --- | ------------- | ---
![philodendron](/img/philodendron.jpg) | wait until 50% of soil is dry before watering | no direct sun, but does not mind a sunny side of the room | only repot if roots are coming out of the inner container. <br><br> Always keep it in a plastic cotainer rather than just the one pot. <br><br>  If leaves are yellow, this means it's overwatered | keep away from pets since it's poisonous to them
