    <td><img src="/img/calathea-musaica.jpg" alt="calathea musaica"/></td>
    <td>
      <b>water</b>: this plant likes water and likes being moist. As soon as the top level dries up, water again. Lots and lots of spraying. Probably everyday or every other day is good. Unless it's in the room with humidifier.
      <br><br>
      <b>sun</b>: Only indirect sunlight. Bright light will make the little network marking disappear.
      <br><br>
      <b>care tips</b>: this plant seems to grow quite quickly in this location, so it will need to be repotted. Best way to repot is to separate its little leaves out. Will need a well draining soil type for next time.  
      <br><br>
      <b>pets</b>: non-toxic to cats. Chashu does like to hunt it though.

      <b>water</b>: pot needs to be well draining since it needs a big pot and you don't want to rot the roots. Spraying leaves is really good for it, and even ocasstional showers in the bathtub. 
      <br><br>
      <b>sun</b>: Light, but not direct light. 
      <br><br>
      <b>care tips</b>: The little brown roots that come out where leaves are at are the way these plants propagate. [The guide on doing that](https://leafandpaw.com/2018/02/19/how-to-propagate-monstera-deliciosa/) is really useful when you want new monsteras

      <br><br>
      <b>care tips</b>: Feed them some fertilizer a few times a month -- its roots are not very strong, so need a bit of help.
      <br><br>
      <b>pets</b>: not toxic to cats. They keep munching on it whenever it's in reach, so probably put a bit further away.
