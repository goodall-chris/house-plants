Spraying the leafs every so often is okay! <br><br> **sun**: sunlight is good! but not the super hot one in the summer. <br><br> **care tips**: if it flowers, leave the stalk after the flowers fade since that's where next flowers will come. <br><br> **pets**: can't find anywhere that says it's toxic to pets, so should be good!

---------- | -----------
![monstera](/img/monstera.jpg) | **water**: pot needs to be well draining since it needs a big pot and you don't want to rot the roots. Spraying leaves is really good for it, and even ocasstional showers in the bathtub. <br><br> **sun**: Light, but not direct light. <br><br> **care tips**: The little brown roots that come out where leaves are at are the way these plants propagate.
